# Medical AI Tools Repository

This project was developed as part of the **Gradio Agents-MCP Hackathon**, which provided API credits to empower developers in building innovative AI-powered demos. Leveraging this opportunity, I have created a series of AI demos focused on healthcare applications. These solutions address use cases such as patient monitoring, diagnostic assistance, medical reporting, and personalized care.
