            <h2>Clinical Significance</h2>
            <div><p>Shortness of breath can be a symptom of various underlying conditions, some of which can be life-threatening if left untreated. The patient's symptoms, which have lasted less than 24 hours, require prompt medical attention to determine the underlying cause and prevent potential complications. Untreated conditions such as pneumonia or pulmonary embolism can lead to severe consequences, including respiratory failure or even death.</p><p>The recommended urgency level is "urgent" because the patient's symptoms require prompt medical attention to determine the underlying cause and prevent potential complications. However, the patient's symptoms do not indicate an immediate life-threatening condition, which would require emergency medical attention.</p></div>

Is it constant or does it come and go?</p><p>Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fever, cough, or chest pain?</p><p>Do you have any underlying medical conditions, such as asthma or COPD?</p><p>Have you recently traveled or been exposed to anyone with a respiratory infection?</p><p>Have you experienced any recent changes in your medications or environment?</p></div>
